    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <!-- Generated with chatGPT - Please generate a funny, scientifically accurate description of the earth that is a few sentences long. -->
    <p>The Earth is the slightly chaotic, middle child of the solar system. It's a waterlogged rock spinning at 1,000
      miles
      per hour while hurtling around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour—no wonder it has a lot of mood swings, from
      tornadoes to earthquakes. It’s got a breathable atmosphere, just the right amount of gravity to keep your coffee
      from floating away, and a diverse collection of ecosystems that somehow include both penguins and camels. In
      short, Earth’s the planet equivalent of an overachiever trying to balance a bunch of different hobbies... with
      occasional volcanic tantrums.</p>
