    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <!-- Generated with chatGPT - Please generate a funny, scientifically accurate description of the moon that is a few sentences long. -->
    <p>The Moon is Earth’s loyal, slightly aloof sidekick, who shows up for every night shift but never stays for the
      after-party. It’s about 1/4th the size of Earth, but it still manages to pull off some serious gravitational
      tricks, like causing tides and occasionally giving us a solar eclipse just to make sure we’re paying attention.
      The Moon’s surface is a dusty, crater-filled wasteland, a perfect reminder that if you don’t have an atmosphere,
      life as we know it becomes a bit... dusty. It also doesn’t have any weather or a breathable atmosphere, which is
      probably why it never gets invited to any cool, Earthly parties.</p>
